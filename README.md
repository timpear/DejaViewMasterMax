Simplified version of the Déjà View Master Max/Jitter patch. An example of how to simultaneously record and read back an updating video loop, by writing individual Matrix frames to disk.

The basic recording principle came from someone on the Cycling 74 forums, and I added the playback scrubber and ability to loop through the zero frame.

This version does not include the input to control the main playhead. The installation used a serial connection to a wireless controller.
